This is a temporary storage location for the deverloper
certificate and its private key so that developers can create
signed rauc upgrade bundles.

Storing private keys for signing secure upadte packages in github
is NOT a good idea. We need an official secure strategy for handling
the update bundle signing certificates and their respective keys.

This folder MUST be removed before the project reaches production state
